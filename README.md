#Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of System did they want you to design?

- The purpose of DriverPass is to provide additional training (if needed) in preparation for their driving test. Once the desired System is completed, the following application shall persist of the Ability for the consumer to create a new account, Allowing customers to sign in from multiple platforms (Computers & Mobileâ€“Devices), Choosing a plan/package based on customers desires, and Inputting personal information. Once completed, the program should initially be capable of internally storing large amounts of data and be fully functional in staying updated based on scheduling, consumer progress, and essential DMV regulations.

#What did you do particularly well?

-I did exceptionally well in Collecting data based on DriverPass requirements by carefully evaluating an interview transcript. As a result, I developed the skillset to draw useful information and collect requirements from a client. With this, I understood what the client wants and needs as it's an essential step in designing a system. It helps you understand your client's needs and gives you the proper foundation for developing a strategy to meet those needs.

#How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?

-Structured design is a conceptualization of a problem into several well-organized elements of a solution. It is concerned with the solution design. The benefit of the structured design is, it gives a better understanding of how the problem is being solved. The structured design also makes it simpler for the designer to concentrate on the problem more accurately

#How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

-Software Design is a process of implementing software solutions to one or more sets of problems. It transforms users' and clients' requirements into some suitable form, which helps programmers in coding and implementation. Software design usually involves problem-solving and planning a software solution. This includes both low-level component and algorithm design, as well as a high-level architecture design.
